      <h2>Asteroid 2024 YR4 could hit Earth in 7 years.</h2>
      <p class="date">February 17, 2025</p>
      <p>Asteroid 2024 YR4, discovered on December 27, 2024, is an Apollo-type near-Earth object with an estimated diameter between 40 and 90 meters. It has a 2% chance of impacting Earth on December 22, 2032, releasing energy equivalent to 7.7 megatons of TNT. The potential impact corridor includes regions such as the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean, northern South America, and parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
      <p>Astronomers are actively monitoring 2024 YR4 to refine its orbit and assess the risk of collision. Observations from telescopes like Gemini South in Chile have provided images of the asteroid, which measures between 131 and 295 feet in width. While the probability of impact is low, the asteroid remains a subject of interest for planetary defense efforts.</p>
